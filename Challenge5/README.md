# Challenge 5
Create a function that will count the number of digits of a number. Conversion of the _number_ to a _string_ is **not allowed**, thus, the approach is either recursive or via loops.

### Examples

    digitsCount(0) ➞ 1
    
    digitsCount(12345)  ➞ 5
    
    digitsCount(1289396387328) ➞ 13

### Notes

*   All inputs are integers but some are in exponential form, so, deal with it accordingly.
